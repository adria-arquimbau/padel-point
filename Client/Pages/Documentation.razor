<h2>Elo Rating System</h2>

<p>
The Elo rating system is used to calculate the relative skill levels of players in games such as chess and padel. It was named after its creator, Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor. In our platform, we use it to calculate and adjust the Elo ratings of padel players after each match.
</p>

<h3>How Elo is Calculated</h3>

<p>
Each player starts with a base Elo rating of 1500. After each match, the system calculates the expected outcome of the match based on the current Elo ratings of the players. This expected outcome is then compared to the actual outcome to adjust the players' Elo ratings.
</p>

<p>
The expected score for a player is calculated using the following formula:
</p>

<pre>
E = 1 / (1 + 10^((R_opponent - R_player) / 400))
</pre>

<p>
Where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>E</strong> is the expected score.</li>
    <li><strong>R_opponent</strong> is the average Elo rating of the opposing team.</li>
    <li><strong>R_player</strong> is the Elo rating of the player.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The actual score is 1 if the player's team won the match, plus the set score difference divided by 10. If the player's team lost, the actual score is 0, plus the set score difference divided by 10.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the new Elo rating for a player is calculated using the following formula:
</p>

<pre>
R_new = R_old + K * (S_actual - E)
</pre>

<p>
Where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>R_new</strong> is the new Elo rating.</li>
    <li><strong>R_old</strong> is the old Elo rating.</li>
    <li><strong>K</strong> is a constant factor that determines the maximum change in rating. In our case, K is 32.</li>
    <li><strong>S_actual</strong> is the actual score.</li>
    <li><strong>E</strong> is the expected score.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that a player's Elo change is also tracked and stored as part of their history. This Elo change is simply the difference between the new Elo rating and the old Elo rating.
</p>

<p>
In this way, the system gives more weight to matches between players of different skill levels. A lower-rated player who wins against a higher-rated player will see a larger increase in their Elo rating compared to if they had won against a player of similar rating.

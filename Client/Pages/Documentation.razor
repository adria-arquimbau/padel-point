<h2>Elo Rating System Explained</h2>

<p>
At our platform, we use the Elo rating system, originally developed for chess, to rank padel players. This system provides a simple, yet effective way to determine a player's skill level relative to others. Each player starts with an initial score of 1500, which changes based on their performance in matches.

<h3>How Does the Elo System Work?</h3>

<p>
Every time a match is played, the system updates the players' ratings. This is done by predicting the outcome of the match before it starts, based on the players' current ratings. We call this the 'expected outcome'. The real outcome of the match is then compared to this expected outcome to adjust the players' ratings.
</p>

<p>
If the outcome is as expected (e.g., the player with the higher rating wins), the ratings change slightly. However, if an upset occurs (e.g., the player with the lower rating wins), the ratings shift more significantly. That means if you manage to beat a stronger opponent, your rating will receive a substantial boost!

<h3>Importance of Match Score</h3>

<p>
In padel, the final score of the match also plays a role in the ratings adjustment. A large margin of victory or defeat will have a greater impact on the rating change compared to a closely fought match. Therefore, even if you lose, a good fight can help maintain your rating.

<h3>Team Dynamics</h3>

<p>
When you're part of a team, the change in your rating depends on your team's performance as well as your own current rating. If you're a beginner playing with a skilled teammate against high-ranked opponents, you can gain more points from a victory and lose fewer from a defeat.

<h3>Elo History</h3>

<p>
We keep a record of your Elo rating changes over time in an 'Elo History'. This allows you to track your progression and see how your skill level has improved with each match. Remember, the key to growth is consistency, so keep playing and strive to improve!

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
The Elo rating system provides a fair and transparent method to rank padel players. While it may seem complex at first, its core principle is simple - performance is rewarded. Win against stronger opponents, hold your ground in every match, and watch your rating soar!
